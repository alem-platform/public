### Terms of service

***I agree that:***
- During the admission period I will be in age between 18 and 40;
- I am aware that I can pass the piscine only once - each participant will only have one opportunity to pass the piscine. It is important to take this event seriously and fully focus on its completion.
- Intensive Study: During the piscine, expect to be at school for at least 30 hours per week. This is an intensive period that requires complete immersion in learning to program. Piscine is not available online.
- Very difficult to combine: Keep in mind that during the piscine it will be difficult to combine study or work. Participation in the piscine requires full dedication and dedication, so it is important to ensure that you have free time and no other responsibilities.
- After successfully passing the 'piscine', the admission dates of my full-time education at alem will be scheduled by its administration;
- My personal data will be processed and used for admission processes.
