### FAQ

We welcome you to the foundation course of the Alem School. Here, you will strengthen your skills in programming in general and the Go language in particular. The course includes both individual and group projects, with core tasks and side quests. We hope you enjoy it!

Although the foundation course is less intensive than a BootCamp, it still requires your time and dedication. Projects will have various deadlines, and missing the main one will block your progress in the course. You won't be able to undo this and continue your education at Alem School.

We have dedicated our best efforts to create the curriculum and find the most interesting projects. We expect you to do the same by committing your time and energy. If you are ready, then go!
