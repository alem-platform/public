## Before you start

Here are two games to assess your memory and logic abilities. They have rules, but we won't tell you what they are â€” you'll have to figure them out yourself. That's part of the challenge.

Find a place where you can pass the games without interruptions. You will have 15 minutes to finish the first game and 1 hour for the second. Once a game starts, there is no pause button, but there will be a break between the games.
